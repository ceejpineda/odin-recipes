        <h2>Homestyle Potato Chips</h2>
        <p>Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last long! A food processor with a slicing attachment is very helpful for slicing the potatoes. Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker or thinner. I like to use olive oil for frying, but you can use safflower, corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced paper-thin </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons salt, plus more to taste </li>
            <li>1 quart oil for deep frying </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong>  Transfer potato slices to a large bowl of cold water as you slice them.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong>  Drain slices and rinse under cold water. Refill the bowl with water, add 3 tablespoons salt, and put slices back in the bowl. Let potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong>  Drain and rinse slices again. Pat dry.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong>  Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong>  Working in small batches, fry potato slices until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Continue until all of the slices are fried.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6</strong>  Season potato chips with additional salt if desired.</li>
        </ol>
